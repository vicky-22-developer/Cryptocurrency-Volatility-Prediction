        "1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure, patterns, and characteristics of cryptocurrency market data. Since cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, EDA helps in identifying trends, fluctuations, outliers, and relationships between variables before applying machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dataset Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of historical cryptocurrency market data containing the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Date – Trading date\n",
        "\n",
        "Open Price – Price at market opening\n",
        "\n",
        "High Price – Highest price of the day\n",
        "\n",
        "Low Price – Lowest price of the day\n",
        "\n",
        "Close Price – Price at market closing\n",
        "\n",
        "Volume – Total trading volume\n",
        "\n",
        "The target variable for this project is volatility, calculated using price fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "The following preprocessing steps were applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "Checked for missing values and handled them using forward filling or removal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Converted the Date column into datetime format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensured all price and volume columns were in numeric format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Removed duplicate records if any.\n",
        "\n",
        "Created a new volatility feature using price variation formulas.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Descriptive Statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum were analyzed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Cryptocurrency prices show high standard deviation, indicating strong volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volume data is positively skewed, meaning few days have extremely high trading activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Price ranges vary significantly across time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Univariate Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Close price distribution shows non-normal behavior with heavy tails.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volume distribution indicates occasional extreme spikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volatility values fluctuate sharply, confirming the unstable nature of crypto markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Bivariate Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Strong correlation observed between High and Low prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volatility increases significantly during periods of high trading volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "Price movements show time-dependent behavior, justifying time-series analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Visualization Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Line plots show frequent sharp upward and downward movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rolling statistics reveal clusters of high volatility.\n",

        "\n",
        "Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and non-stationary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volatility is influenced by both price range and volume.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data is suitable for machine learning and time-series models after preprocessing."
